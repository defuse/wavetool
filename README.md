# wavetool

wavetool is a processing/analysis tool for Serum wavetables. It can:

- Generate a spectrogram from a wavetable.
- Filter harmonics in various ways:
    - Keep only the even/odd harmonics.
    - Specify a bitmap of harmonics to keep.
    - Specify a repeating pattern of harmonics to keep.
    - Keep/remove branches of the wavetable's prime factorization tree.
- Factor a wavetable into its prime-multiple-of-fundamental components.
